# Fight The Future Alerts
A WordPress plugin to show Fight for the Future alerts on your website.

## Description

This plugin shows alerts from [Fight for the Future](https://fightforthefuture.org) on your WordPress site.

You can show a modal windows for a specific day of action.

**I do not support issues with the modals themselves!** If the javascript is loaded on your page, regardless of how wonky it looks, then the plugin works. If the boxes look back or cause weird errors, you'll have to take it up with Fight for the Future directly.

### Pick your Battles

* [Blackout Congress (ongoing)](https://blackoutcongress.org)
* [Battle for the Net (2017 July 12)](https://battleforthenet.com)

## Installation Instructions

1. Go to Tools -> FFTF
2. Select which days of action you wish to show

## FAQ

### Are you the official plugin?

No, this is something I made for myself.

### Can I test it?

Yes.

* Blackout Congress - Enable `WP_DEBUG` on your site to show the modal to everyone
* Battle for the Net - Add `#ALWAYS_SHOW_BFTN_WIDGET` to the end of your URL to see the modal

## Will you add more fights?

Yes I will.

## Will this work on all websites?

Probably not. If you have a ton of javascript, it may have issues.
